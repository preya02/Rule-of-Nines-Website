<title>The Rule of Nines</title>
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Rule of Nines of Burns</h1>
<h2 style="color:Brown;">What is a burn?</h2>
<p style=background-color:lightyellow;"> According to World Health Organization, a burn is an injury to the skin or other organic tissue primarily caused by heat or due to radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction or contact with chemicals.
Thermal (heat) burns occur when some or all the cells in the skin or other tissues are destroyed by:
-hot liquids (scalds),-hot solids (contact burns),-flames (flame burns).
<p style=background-color:lightyellow;"> Burns are painful wounds caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, or electromagnetic activity. The two main factors that cause burn injuries in older persons are smoking and open flames. The most common cause of burn injuries in youngsters is scorching. Older persons and infants are more vulnerable to burn injuries.</p>

<h2 style="color:Brown;">What are the clasifications of burns?</h2>
<p style=background-color:lightyellow;"> Burns are classified as first-, second-, or third-degree, depending on how deep and severely they penetrate the skin's surface.</p>
<p style=background-color:lightyellow;"> •First-degree (superficial) burns. First-degree burns affect only the epidermis, or outer layer of skin. The burn site is red, painful, dry, and with no blisters. Mild sunburn is an example. Long-term tissue damage is rare and usually involves an increase or decrease in the skin color.<p>

<p style=background-color:lightyellow;"> •Second-degree (partial thickness) burns. Second-degree burns involve the epidermis and part of the dermis layer of skin. The burn site appears red, blistered, and may be swollen and painful.<p>

<p style=background-color:lightyellow;"> •Third-degree (full thickness) burns. Third-degree burns destroy the epidermis and dermis. Third-degree burns may also damage the underlying bones, muscles, and tendons. When bones, muscles, or tendons are also burned, this may be referred to as a fourth-degree burn. The burn site appears white or charred. There is no feeling in the area since the nerve endings are destroyed.<p>

<h1 style="color:Brown;">What is the Rule of Nines?</h1>
<p style=background-color:lightyellow;"> The Rule of Nines, also known as the Wallace Rule of Nines, is a tool used by trauma and emergency medicine providers to assess the total body surface area (TBSA) involved in burn patients.Since patients with severe burns would lose a significant amount of fluid due to the elimination of their skin barrier, measuring the initial burn surface area is crucial for calculating the amount of fluid that will be needed for fluid resuscitation.) </p>
<p style=background-color:lightyellow;">This tool helps the healthcare provider quickly estimate the severity and IV fluid requirements of burns that are only of the second-degree burns, also known as partial-thickness burns and third-degree burns, known as full-thickness burns. It divides the body surface into areas of nine percent (%) or multiples of nine
percent, with the exception that the perineum is estimated at one percent (%).</p>

<h1 style="color:Brown;">How is the Rule of Nines used?</h1>
<p style=background-color:LightYellow;">A physician can apply the rule of nines computations in a variety of ways. This covers the volume of fluid refill and level of personal care required.<p>
<p style=background-color:lightyellow;">The outermost layer of skin is destroyed in cases of second-degree burns or worse. They will thus lose a substantial amount of bodily water. This makes giving someone fluids essential for maintaining their body's water balance. Significant intravenous (IV) fluids are needed for burns that cover more than 20 to 25 percent of the body's surface area, according to the National Institutes of Health. The estimated body surface area burned will also be used by medical professionals to calculate the appropriate fluid dosage.<p>
<p style=background-color:lightyellow;">The rule of nines can also relay to a medical team receiving the patient how serious the injury is. Providers also know that burns that exceed 30 percent of a person’s body can be potentially fatal, according to the National Institutes of Health.
If a person has burns on 10 percent of their body surface area or greater, a specialized burn center should treat their wounds.<p>
<h2 style="color:Tomato;">Rule of Nines in Adults</h2>
<p>The rule of nines assigns a percentage that’s either nine or a multiple of nine to determine how much body surface area is damaged. For adults, the rule of nines is:<p>
<table border="1">
	<thead>
	 <tr>
			<th>Body Part</td>
			<th>Percentage</th>
     </tr>
	 <tr>
		<td>Arm</td>
		<td>9% each</td>
	</tr>
	 <tr>
		<td>Anterior Trunk</td>
		<td>18%</td>
		</tr>
	 <tr>
		<td>Genitalia</td>
		<td>1%</td>
		</tr>
	 <tr>
		<td>Head and Neck</td>
		<td>9%</td>
		</tr>
	 <tr>
		<td>Legs(including the feet)</td>
		<td>18% each</td>
		</tr>
	 <tr>
		<td>Posterior Trunk</td>
		<td>18% </td>
		</tr>
	 </table>
	 </body>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If a person’s injured due to a burn, a doctor may assess them quickly. For example, if they were burned on each hand and arm as well as the front trunk portion of the body, using the rule of nines, they’d estimate the burned area as 36 percent of a person’s body.<p>
<h2 style="color:Tomato;">Rule of Nines in Children</h2>
<p>Physicians usually do not use the same computations in the rule of nines to pediatric patients. This is due to the fact that children often have larger heads and shorter legs than adults do. For instance, the National Institutes of Health states that children typically have a head that is 20% larger than that of adults. Moreover, an infant's leg length is 13% less than an adult's. Therefore, there are a few adjustments for the rule of nines in children:<p>
<table border="1">
	<thead>
	 <tr>
			<th>Body Part</td>
			<th>Percentage</th>
     </tr>
	 <tr>
		<td>Arm</td>
		<td>9% each</td>
	</tr>
	 <tr>
		<td>Anterior Trunk</td>
		<td>18%</td>
		</tr>
	 <tr>
		<td>Head and Neck</td>
		<td>18%</td>
		</tr>
	 <tr>
		<td>Legs(including the feet)</td>
		<td>14% each</td>
		</tr>
	 <tr>
		<td>Posterior Trunk</td>
		<td>18%</td>
		</tr>
	 </table>
	 </body>
  </tr>
</table>
